Inflammasomes are supramolecular micron-sized complexesthat assemble in the cytosol adjacent to the nucleus in response topathogens and other damage-associated signals. The core ofinflammasomes consists of at least 2 components: a signal sensor andan effector inflammatory caspase (mostly CASP1). However, mostinflammasomes contain a third element, an adaptor (often ASC/PYCARD)In response to a danger signal, the sensor homooligomerizes andinteracts with the adaptor that polymerizes and forms a platform torecruit caspase precursors. This results in increased localconcentration of the enzyme, leading to trans-autocleavage andactivation. Active caspases process proinflammatory IL1B and IL18cytokine precursors, which are then secreted in the extracellularmilieu and induce inflammatory responses.

These processesinclude the post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA by either RNAinterference (RNAi) or endogenously encoded microRNAs (miRNAs) and thetranscriptional regulation of mRNA by RNAi-mediated chromatinsilencing. RNAi is generally triggered by the presence of dsRNAproduced by bidirectional transcription or by the transcription of aninverted repeat or hairpin sequence. dsRNA is processed into smallinterfering RNAs (siRNAs) of around 21 nucleotide which are thenincorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), whichcleaves mRNAs with sequences fully complementary to the siRNA. miRNAsdiffer from siRNAs principally in their biogenesis. miRNA genes encodeprecursors with complex hairpin structures which are processed byendonucleolytic cleavage to form mature miRNAs. Like siRNAs, miRNAsfunction in RISC-like complexes. Animal miRNAs generally inhibittranslation of target mRNAs following imperfect base pairing to the3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR), while most plant miRNAs show nearlyprecise complementarity to coding regions of target mRNAs and triggermRNA degradation similar to siRNAs.

KW-1264,Keyword,KW-1264,Viral receptor tropism switching,Biological process,"A switch in the host range specificity occurs in some bacterialviruses through massive sequence variation of their host-bindingreceptor. Sequence variation can be induced by site-specific inversionof a DNA segment in their genome or by a diversity-generatingretroelement. Inversion is catalyzed by a specific recombinase calledinvertase and consists of a reciprocal recombination event within twoinverted repeats present in the viral genome that leads to thealternate expression of two different sets of genes involved in tailfiber biosynthesis. Mu-like viruses and P1-like viruses, for example,encode a recombinase responsible for the switch in the targeted hostDiversity-generating retroelements (DGR) like in BPP-1 virus alsoallow tropism switching by creating a mutant copy of an invariant DNAtemplate repeat by transcription and reverse transcription andintroducing this mutated sequence in the receptor-binding proteinsequence"

This hydrophilic channeldirects the viral genome, and possibly some specific proteins, intothe cytoplasm and protects it from periplasmic nucleases. Once theviral genome is in the host cytoplasm, the channel collapses andseals. Bacteriophage T7 for example expresses ejection proteins thatpartition into the host outer and cytoplasmic membranes and allowtransport of viral DNA across the host envelope.
